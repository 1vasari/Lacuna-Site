The Lacuna Expanse, and the users of the game, defining the nature of the service the company provides.
</p>

</li></ol>
</li><li> Content.
<ol><li> Participatory Content. As part of our interactive approach, Lacuna Expanse Corp provides you with certain
opportunities to submit your own ideas, text, graphics, missions, buildings, plots, characters, feedback and other
materials while you participate in the Games, forums, chat rooms and other activities in the Site or Services
(collectively, "Participatory Content"). By submitting any Participatory Content, you represent and warrant
that you are the owner of or have the right to post your Participatory Content, and your Participatory Content
does not infringe the rights of any third party. You hereby grant Lacuna Expanse Corp a perpetual, irrevocable,
non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
distribute, publicly display and perform any and all of your Participatory Content in all media now known or
later developed. You, and not Lacuna Expanse Corp, are entirely responsible for all of your Participatory Content
that you upload, post, email or otherwise transmit via the Site, Services or Games.
</li><li> Third Party Content. You acknowledge and agree that the Site, Services and Games contain
materials owned by Lacuna Expanse Corp and its licensors (including other members), and you agree not
to interfere the copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights of such parties. You agree that these
rights are valid and protected in all media existing now or later developed, and that except as is
explicitly provided otherwise, your use of such materials shall be governed by the copyright laws of the United States
and other applicable laws.
</li><li> Content Monitoring. As a matter of policy, Lacuna Expanse Corp does not manually pre-screen or monitor
the content that you or other members may post to the The Lacuna Expanse site or game. Lacuna Expanse Corp does use
automated mechanisms as necessary to filter obscene or vulgar language. Lacuna Expanse Corp does reserve the right to
monitor all such content, and reserves the right to remove without notice any and all content that Lacuna Expanse Corp,
in its sole discretion, finds offensive or otherwise objectionable. You are solely responsible, and bear the risk,
for evaluating the accuracy, integrity, quality, completeness or utility of any content. Lacuna Expanse Corp makes no
representations or warranties about the content appearing in The Lacuna Expanse Under no circumstances will Lacuna
Expanse Corp be liable in any way for any content, including but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any
content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed or
otherwise transmitted via The Lacuna Expanse
</li><li> Mature Content. While The Lacuna Expanse is intended to be a game for all ages, it does allow for user generated
content both in the game and on the site. As a result parts of the Site, Services and/or Games contain adult or mature content
that some users may consider offensive, indecent or objectionable. While Lacuna Expanse Corp has established a list of
restrictions and may in some instances choose to monitor and take action upon inappropriate gameplay, chat or links to
the Services, it is possible that at any time there may be language or other material accessible on or through the Site,
Services or Games that may be offensive or objectionable to some users.
</li><li> Content Transmission. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Services, including
your Participatory Content and Public Content, may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; and (ii) changes to
conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
</li><li> Links. The Site, Services and Games may provide links to other sites for your convenience only. Lacuna Expanse
Corp does not control, is not responsible for, does not necessarily endorse and makes no representation about the
materials contained at any linked site. If you choose to visit any linked Sites, Lacuna Expanse Corp recommends
that you review the other site's terms of use. Lacuna Expanse Corp is not responsible for webcasting or any other form of
transmission received from any linked site.
</li><li> Names. In creating your empire in The Lacuna Expanse we ask that you use names appropriate for the setting.
Do not use names that violate these terms, that might be offensive to other players, or that include copyright or trademark
characters or products. Avoid names that are from or imply popular media and culture. Lacuna Expanse Corp will arbitrarily
change any names it considers unsuitable, or ban the accounts associated. Other than in these circumstances, names will not
generally be changed.
</li><li> Auctions and Sales. It is against Lacuna Expanse Corp policy to allow accounts,
subscription time, or Essentia to be sold - for real money, on auction sites, or otherwise. We will ask auction sites to
respect this policy. We only allow trading of The Lacuna Expanse items within the game in exchange for other The Lacuna Expanse
items. We do not allow trades concerning any other game's accounts, items, or money to be performed, advertised, or solicited.
We will terminate accounts that we believe are in violation of this policy.
</li><li> Essentia. It is against Lacuna Expanse Corp's policy to allow players to trade Essentia on third-party sites.
We will terminate accounts that we believe have violated this policy.
</li></ol>
</li><li> Idea submission policy. Lacuna Expanse Corp and its employees do not accept or consider unsolicited ideas,
including but not limited to ideas for advertising campaigns, technology development or product names. Please do not send
Lacuna Expanse Corp or any of its employees any unsolicited materials, including any artwork or demos. If any area of the
site, services or games invites you to submit material, such as a portfolio URL for a job application, such submission
shall not be deemed to be unsolicited for purposes of this section ("Idea Submission Policy"). The purpose of this policy
is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes if Lacuna Expanse Corp' products or marketing strategies might seem
similar to ideas submitted to Lacuna Expanse Corp. Please note that any material you submit to Lacuna Expanse Corp in
any manner, aside from examples of prior work as part of a job application, will be deemed your "Participatory Content"
and subject to the terms of participatory content in this agreement.
</li><li> Your Account is Your Responsibility. You are solely responsible and entirely liable for all activities
conducted through your account and/or your username, even if your account has been compromised through no fault of your
own. Lacuna Expanse Corp encourages you to maintain the confidentiality of your password, and reminds you that you do
not have a license to let others use your account. You agree to notify Lacuna Expanse Corp immediately in the event
your password is lost, stolen, disclosed or compromised. It is not Lacuna Expanse Corp' policy to ask for your
password online, and Lacuna Expanse Corp suggests that you never respond to an on-line request for your password.
</li><li> Privacy. You understand that you have no expectation of privacy with respect to your use of the Site,
Services or Games, and that all communications made by or received from you may be monitored, preserved and
disclosed by Lacuna Expanse Corp representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system profile data
and any data related to operation of the software from any computer that logs on to the Site, Services or Games using
your account. You acknowledge and agree that Lacuna Expanse Corp will report to law enforcement authorities any actions
which may be considered illegal, as well as any reports it receives of such conduct. Lacuna Expanse Corp will cooperate
fully with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity. Specifically, Lacuna Expanse Corp
may disclose information about you or your Participatory Content if Lacuna Expanse Corp has the good faith belief that
such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms; (c) respond to
claims that any your Participatory Content violates the rights of a third party; or (d) protect the rights, property
or safety of Lacuna Expanse Corp, its members or the public. These Terms are also subject to Lacuna Expanse Corp'
general <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by this reference as if set out in full.
</li><li> Charges for Service. Lacuna Expanse Corp charges a fee for the in-game currency which may be traded in-game for
certain services. You may
also choose to pay additional fees for additional services ("Premium Services"). ALL FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND
ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES UNDER YOUR ACCOUNT WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.
If your use of The Lacuna Expanse is subject to any use, sales or other taxes, or if Lacuna Expanse Corp offers
any additional services for a fee as noted on the Site and you choose to partake in such additional fee-services,
then Lacuna Expanse Corp may also bill you for any such charges.
Lacuna Expanse Corp reserves the right to change its fees and billing methods at any time effective thirty (30) days
after notice of the changes are posted on the Site. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms to
obtain timely notice of such changes. If any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your account
and this agreement as provided in the "Termination" section. Your continued use of the Games or Services
seven (7) days after the changes are posted on the Site will constitute your acceptance of such change. If you pay
for the Games and/or Services by credit card, you represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of such
credit card. 
</li><li> International Use. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules
regarding online conduct and acceptable content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the
transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.

in and to the Site, Services and Games, except to the extent of the licenses granted to you hereunder. Lacuna Expanse Corp,
